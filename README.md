### UC Berkeley - Intro to Artificial Intelligence, Summer 2023

- In this semester's offering, topics differed from previous offerings (30% of the material was focused on ML and RL). Topics include:
- Search (Graph, Tree, A*, Heuristics)
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems
- Games (MiniMax, Pruning, Adversarial Search)
- Bayesian Networks (Variable Elimination, Probabilistic Inference, Rejection, Gibbs, MCMC, Likelihood)
- Hidden Markov Models (Particle Filtering, Inference, Smoothing, Prediction, Dynamic Bayes Nets)
- Markov Decision Processes (Policies, Q-Values)
- Reinforcement Learning (TD, Q-Learning, Policy Gradients)
- Machine Learning (Perceptrons, Classification Methods, Regularization, Smoothing, MLE, Loss Functions)
- Neural Networks (Architecture, Forward/Back-Propogation, Representation)
